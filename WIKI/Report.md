# Introduction
This text-based choose your own adventure game was created by Michael Brown and Carl Porter, III on December 2nd, 2023. The project was created to entertain Dr. Jamieson and our fellow students as the game places the user in the shoes of a student taking an ECE 287 exam. The game is not serious and involves the user succeeding or failing in different comical ways. There are twenty four game states with nine endings. We greatly enjoyed creating this game and hope that everyone that plays it enjoys it.
# Overview of Functionality
Our main project file is FinalProject.v which declares the pins that we are using on the DE2-115 board and instantiates the game.v module and the vga_driver_memory_double_buf.v module. These modules control the game states and the VGA output respectively. The first file, game.v, is simple and implements a finite state machine to transition through states depending on user input from the four push buttons on the DE2-115 board. To ensure that the user only makes one selection with each button press, the state confirmInput uses the LS variable which contains the last state of the finite state machine, to transition the machine once the user releases the button. Each state adjusts the frame variable which is passed to the vga_driver_memory_double_buf.v module through the FinalProject.v module. This large bus contains seven-bit memory addresses for all 192 characters that can be diplayed at a time. These addresses correspond to drawing data in the CharacterArray memory module made with the Quartus IP tool. The frame variable stores the input from the game.v module in the vga_driver_memory_double_buf.v module where it is iterated through by shifting through its bits to proved the appropriate memory addresses to the character_buf_mem_address variable that intereacts with the CharacterArray.v module to update current_character. The variable current_character is iterated through by shifting its bits to either write white or blue to the memory of one of the two frame buffers. These frame buffers and the VGA driver were written by Dr. Jamieson. We modified the writing and reading of the vga_driver_memory_double_buf.v module so that we could write characters to the display. To write characters into the memory of the inactive buffer, we write the data encoded in current character in ten by ten squares using different counters to move the write_buf_mem_address variable to the correct position as the correct time. When the memory is read from, multiple counters ensure that each line of data is read four times as we are downscaling the display from 640x480 to 160x120 as the DE2-115 board does not contain enough memory to display a full 640x480 frame. A finite state machine controls these variables and initializes the VGA display to a solid color so we always have a known state from which to start.
